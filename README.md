# WeakAuras Exporter

</div>

Small little utility addon that will allow you to mass export your weakauras as export strings. This way you can share them faster or update your UI faster (if you're using somebody else's public UI). The latter reason being why I created this addon to begin with. It was made within about an hour or two so if you see any bugs or issues just hmu or contribute.


## TLDR

Type `/wae`, use addon.

## How to use

To open the exporter window, type `/wae` into your chat and hit enter. You can then press on any of your weakauras in the left pane and the export string will be avilable on the right for quick access.

Back them up wherever you please, then when the time is right type `/wa` and hit enter and press the import button at the top and paste the export string into the box.
